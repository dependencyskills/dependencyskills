#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Two-way sync between docs/knowledge/ and the GitHub repo wiki.
#
# Model: git is the merge engine on BOTH sides - the wiki is itself a git
# repo (<repo>.wiki.git). Content flows both ways per-page, three-way
# merged against a recorded base (KB_DIR/.gh-wiki-sync/ - commit it,
# never hand-edit). Structure flows UP: the wiki has no hierarchy UI, so
# the docs/knowledge/ tree owns the layout - page names encode the path
# (Architecture-Decisions-Foo) and a generated _Sidebar.md shows the
# tree. A page created fresh in the wiki UI lands at the KB root on pull,
# reported for filing; moving it into a section renames the page on the
# next sync.
#
# Mapping: docs/knowledge/README.md <-> Home; a section's README.md <->
# the section page (Architecture-Decisions); leaves <-> path-joined
# pages. _Sidebar.md is generated - wiki-side edits to it are
# overwritten. A local move shows up as a page rename (content match);
# move+edit degrades to delete+create - pass --allow-delete after a
# reorganize to prune the old page.
#
# Usage: gh-wiki-sync.sh [KB_DIR] [options]
#   KB_DIR          sync domain (default ./docs/knowledge)
#   --repo O/R      GitHub repo (default: tracker.repo from
#                   .agents/config/story-tools.json)
#   --pull-only     apply wiki -> local only; local changes reported pending
#   --allow-delete  a locally deleted file deletes its wiki page
#   --new-section N approve publishing a top-level section not seen before
#                   (repeatable). Sub-groups inside a known section need no
#                   approval - only a new top-level directory does.
#   --force         bootstrap over a non-empty KB_DIR with no sync state:
#                   local files are adopted and pushed as pages
#   --short-page-names
#                   drop a record id (ADR-0004-, RAD-0023-, ...) from the
#                   page name, so GitHub's title stops repeating it above
#                   the document's own H1. OFF by default: turning it on
#                   RENAMES every affected page and breaks inbound links.
#                   Persist it as "wikiShortPageNames": true in the pointer.
#   --dry-run       print the full action plan; change nothing anywhere
#   --help          this text
#
# Conflicts get git-style markers and are NEVER pushed until the markers
# are gone - resolve locally, then sync again.
# Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 error, 2 completed but conflicts need resolution.

# CHANGING THIS BREAKS THE NEW-SECTION GUARD - fix both in one commit.
# The guard decides "this section is already published" by testing live page
# names against page_for(sec + '/README.md') + '-', which encodes the
# flattening separator. Give pages real paths and every section fails the
# test, so the sync hard-exits on every run asking to approve sections that
# have existed for months. Replace the prefix test with a directory-existence
# check against the wiki clone at the same time: that tests the fact rather
# than a name derived from it, and survives any later naming change.
# A leading record id in the filename (ADR-0004-, RAD-0023-, PRD-0003-,
# STRY-0042-) is dropped from the page name. GitHub renders the page NAME as
# the page title, above the document's own H1, so keeping it showed the id
# twice and put the least useful words first: "Research RAD 0001 Identifier
# And Text Normalization" over "# Normalizing for blind matching". The id
# stays in the filename, where it guarantees uniqueness, and on the
# identifier line in the body, where the skill says it belongs.
# A closed set, not a shape. An id-shaped pattern also matches a real title:
# reference/ISO-8601-dates.md would publish as 'Reference-Dates', silently
# losing the part that identified it.
#
# But a closed set fails badly on a NEAR miss. A project using a prefix one
# letter from a recognised one keeps its ids, which reads as the feature
# being broken rather than as a deliberate refusal - and from outside there
# is no way to tell those two apart.
#
# So an id-shaped prefix that is NOT recognised is reported at the end of a
# run rather than silently declined, and the next case arrives as a line of
# output instead of as a bug report. SPEC- is the live example: it is
# deliberately absent, because a specification is a DOC- in specifications/,
# and a project still writing SPEC- learns that from the report.
