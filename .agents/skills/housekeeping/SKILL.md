# Housekeeping

## Quick start

When concluding a session: review modified files, clean up debug artifacts,
reconcile the work with the focused story, preserve decisions, and prepare
the Git commit message and PR description.

## Workflows

Execute the following steps in order at the end of a work session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Execution Rule**: Before executing each step, ask the user if they want
> to run that specific step. If they decline, skip it and move immediately
> to the next step.

### Step 1: Code cleanliness & cleanup audit

Inspect the codebase and remove development artifacts before documenting:

- [ ] Remove temporary comments (`TODO: temporary fix`, personal notes).
- [ ] Remove development-only logs, print/console statements.
- [ ] Remove unused variables, imports, or dependencies.
- [ ] Clean up or delete scratch files created in the workspace.

### Step 2: Environment & configuration check

Did the session introduce environment variables, configuration settings,
or dependencies?

- [ ] New environment variables documented (README, setup scripts, .env.example).
- [ ] Package manifests updated and dependencies documented.

### Step 3: Story reconciliation & remaining work

Compare the session's work against its objectives — which, when a story is
focused, means the story's AC checklist (story-workflow skill):

- [ ] AC items verifiably completed this session are toggled on the story.
- [ ] Deferred work, edge cases, and technical debt are logged as tracker
      issues — the discovered-work off-ramp for things found mid-session,
      or the to-issues skill for a planned batch. Never local TODO/gap files.
- [ ] If the story might be complete, run the completion check
      (story-workflow) — don't declare it done otherwise.
- [ ] Propose the session's time entry: end minus session start, rounded
      to 15 minutes, ONE entry on the story that got most of the session
      ("~2h on PROJ-123 - log it as effort?"). Record via story-workflow's
      `effort.log`, and only against the focused story - a whole working
      day is a work log, not issue effort
      only after the user approves the number. Never log silently.

### Step 4: Context preservation & decisions

Preserve key discussions, setup steps, and architectural choices before
the conversation is lost. File per the project-docs taxonomy:

- [ ] Design decisions → the Architecture Decision Records section of
      `docs/knowledge/`; investigations that led to them → the Research
      section (the to-research skill for audit-grade RAD records). Run
      the project-docs sync after filing.
- [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` if project setup steps changed.
- [ ] If transitioning to another agent/session, use the `handoff` skill
      (it posts to the focused story when one exists).

### Step 5: Commit & PR documentation prep

Prepare version control and team documentation from the clean, complete
state:

- [ ] Draft a structured commit message (e.g., conventional commits),
      referencing the story ID.
- [ ] Write a PR description detailing scope, rationale, and verification
      results — the story's AC checklist is the verification summary;
      link the story rather than restating it.
