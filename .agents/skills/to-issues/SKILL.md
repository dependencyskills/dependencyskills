# To Issues

Break a plan into independently-grabbable stories using vertical slices
(tracer bullets), published to the project's tracker in the canonical story
format so the story-workflow skill can pick each one up directly.

**Tracker dispatch:** read `.agents/config/story-tools.json` →
`tracker.type` (absent → `youtrack`) and use that binding's commands:

- `youtrack` → [references/tracker-youtrack.md](references/tracker-youtrack.md)
- `github` → [references/tracker-github.md](references/tracker-github.md)

Story bodies follow [references/ac-format.md](references/ac-format.md) —
the same contract every story-tools skill parses.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation. If the user passes an
issue reference (ID, URL, or a PRD path), fetch/read it fully — body,
comments, requirements.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you haven't already, explore enough to use the project's domain glossary
in titles and descriptions, and to respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** stories. Each is a thin vertical
slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal
slice of one layer.

Slices may be **HITL** (require human interaction — an architectural
decision, a design review) or **AFK** (implementable and mergeable without
human interaction). Prefer AFK where possible.

- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer
  (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice: **Title**,
**Type** (HITL/AFK), **Blocked by** (which slices must complete first),
**Requirements covered** (R-numbers / user stories from the source PRD),
**Priority** (proposed - default Normal; the user owns the final call),
**Subsystem** (which component of the monorepo the slice lands in - a
vertical slice may touch several; name the one that owns it; fetch the
project's available values via the binding's dimensions tool and show
them - propose your inference, never invent near-duplicates), and
**Estimate** (a rough one: 1h / 4h / 1d - calibration data, not a promise).
If the work targets a release, confirm it once for the batch - release
membership is the **Fix versions** field, never a tag.

Ask: does the granularity feel right? Are the dependencies correct? Should
any slices merge or split? Are HITL/AFK assignments right? Do the
priorities and estimates look sane? Iterate until approved.

### 5. Publish to the tracker

For each approved slice, create a story via the tracker binding, in
dependency order (blockers first) so you can reference real IDs. Each story
body, in canonical format:

```markdown
## Purpose
<why this slice is necessary and what problem it solves - THIS slice's
why, not the feature's. Link the PRD rather than restating it.>

## Specification
<required behaviour in detail: the contract, edge cases, error and empty
states, boundaries. What must be true, not which files to touch. No file
paths or implementation plans, except a prototype-derived snippet that
encodes a decision (state machine, schema, type shape) - trimmed to the
decision-rich parts. "None beyond the AC." for a genuinely trivial slice.>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Verifiable outcome 1
- [ ] Verifiable outcome 2

## References
- <KB article ID + title of the source PRD, e.g. EVO-A-41 Some Feature>
- <parent issue ID, if the source was an issue>
```

Write both sections as prose, not bullet fragments. The story is read cold
by whoever picks it up; a checklist alone makes them reconstruct the intent.
Purpose is required on every story. Specification is required wherever
anything is non-obvious, which is most of them.

Then, via the binding: link blockers (depends-on), set each story's
Priority, Subsystem, and Estimation as approved, tag every story `triaged`
(the quiz WAS its triage - these stories are born dispositioned, and
`tag: -triaged` must stay the reliable untriaged-work query), tag AFK
slices `ready-for-agent`, tag
`needs-gherkin` where a slice has strict rules or planned test automation,
and apply one shared **topical tag** to the whole batch - Title Case,
human-readable, usually the feature or PRD name ("Trust Insights") - so the
slices group together in searches and board swimlanes. Reuse the project's
existing topical tags where one fits; never invent near-duplicates. If a
target release was confirmed, set Fix versions on each story.

### 6. Close the loop

If the source was a PRD, update its `## Stories` table with the new IDs
and the requirements each covers. Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.
